   - **Auditory**: The Valve Index uses near-ear audio technology to deliver high-quality spatial sound, improving user orientation and environmental awareness.
   - **Tactile**: HaptX Gloves provide detailed tactile feedback, simulating the sensation of touch, such as feeling textures or grasping objects, enhancing the realism of interaction.
   - **Olfactory**: Devices like FeelReal can simulate environmental scents, such as the freshness of a forest or the aroma of coffee, adding depth to the immersive experience.

2. **Improved Physical Affordance**:
   - **Lightweight Design**: The Oculus Go features lightweight materials and design, reducing the burden on the head for more comfortable long-term wear.
   - **Adjustable Supports**: The HTC Vive Pro's head mount can be adjusted for the user's head size and shape, offering a more comfortable and secure fit.

3. **Enhanced Functional Affordance**:
   - **Motion Tracking**: The Valve Index controllers feature finger tracking technology, capturing hand and finger movements precisely for more natural interaction.
   - **Eye Tracking**: Devices like the HTC Vive Pro Eye use eye-tracking technology to accurately capture the user's gaze and eye movements, enhancing interaction's naturalness and accuracy.

4. **Broader Application Scenarios and Research Possibilities**:
   - **Education and Training**: VR devices are used for virtual laboratory operations or surgical simulations, like using the Oculus Rift for virtual anatomy teaching, providing a risk-free practice environment.
   - **Psychological Therapy**: Devices like the PSVR are used for exposure therapy, helping patients with anxiety disorders or PTSD to confront and process their fears in a controlled environment.

These feature developments and applications show the progress of VR technology in enhancing multisensory experiences and interactive design, not only improving the quality of user experience but also providing powerful tools for research and applications across various fields.

具体例子中的VR设备功能如下：

1. **增强的多感官模拟**：
   - 视觉：如Oculus Quest 2提供的更高分辨率和刷新率，可以减少视觉模糊和延迟，提供更清晰、更流畅的图像，增强视觉沉浸感。
   - 听觉：例如Valve Index使用的近耳音频技术，提供高质量的空间音效，增强用户的方向感和环境感知。
   - 触觉：如HaptX Gloves提供的精细触觉反馈，能模拟真实的触感，如触摸、抓握物体的感觉，增强交互的真实性。
   - 嗅觉：使用如FeelReal等设备，能模拟环境的气味，如森林的清新或咖啡的香味，增加了沉浸式体验的深度。

2. **改善的物理舒适性（Physical Affordance）**：
   - 轻量化设计：如Oculus Go采用的轻量化材料和设计，减轻了头部负担，使长时间佩戴更为舒适。
   - 调整性支架：如HTC Vive Pro的头戴支架设计，可以根据用户的头部大小和形状进行调整，提供更贴合、更舒适的佩戴体验。

3. **功能性提升（Functional Affordance）**：
   - 动作追踪：如Valve Index控制器的指尖追踪技术，能精准捕捉手部和指尖的动作，提供更自然的交互体验。
   - 眼动追踪：设备如HTC Vive Pro Eye，通过眼动追踪技术，能够精确捕捉用户的视线和眼部动作，增强交互的自然度和精准性。

4. **更广泛的应用场景与研究可能性**：
   - 教育培训：使用VR设备进行虚拟实验室操作或手术模拟，如使用Oculus Rift进行虚拟解剖学教学，提供无风险的实践环境。
   - 心理治疗：如使用PSVR进行暴露疗法，帮助焦虑症或PTSD患者在控制的环境中面对和处理他们的恐惧。

这些功能的发展和应用展示了VR技术在多感官体验和交互设计方面的进步，不仅提升了用户体验的质量，也为不同领域的研究和应用提供了强大的工具。

**VR tasks to assess kinesthetic changes**

When conducting a virtual task where users are comparing a design piece and modifying a similar design piece (e.g., changing line width, adding symbols, and changing color schemes), with a countdown timer provided, the following hypotheses can be made to associate changes in the kinesthetic system (such as head turns, eye movements, and hand drawing accuracy) with changes in the external environment's comfort:

1. **visual comfort**:
   - Hypothesis: If the virtual environment is more comfortable, users may experience less eye fatigue, reducing the blink rate and increasing the accuracy of eye movements.

2. **Background Noise Level**:
   - Hypothesis: Working in a virtual environment with a lower noise level may make users feel more relaxed, reducing involuntary eye twitches or head turns due to stress.

**Personal Fans or Air Circulators:**
Controlling personal fans or air circulators within a virtual reality (VR) system can be achieved through the integration of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and smart home technologies. Here's how this can be done:

1. **Smart Plugs**:
   - Connect fans or air circulators to smart plugs that can be controlled remotely. These plugs can be turned on or off, and in some cases, have their speed settings adjusted through a companion app or virtual reality interface.

2. **Direct Integration**:
   - Some fans and air circulators are available as "smart" devices with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. These can be controlled natively through a VR system by integrating the fan's API into the VR software.

3. **VR Controller**:
   - Use the VR controller to simulate the operation of a fan or air circulator. The VR system can be programmed to send control signals to the connected smart device when certain gestures or button presses are made.

4. **Voice Commands**:
   - Integrate voice recognition within the VR system to allow users to control fans using voice commands. This can be done through existing virtual assistants that are IoT-enabled, like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.
