## 20240520 Prototype Details
### Example of Balanced Crossover Design

Suppose there are four experimental conditions: Control (C), Experimental Group 1 (E1), Experimental Group 2 (E2), and Experimental Group 3 (E3). A Latin square can be used to arrange the experiment order:

| Participant | Order 1 | Order 2 | Order 3 | Order 4 |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1           | C       | E1      | E2      | E3      |
| 2           | E1      | E2      | E3      | C       |
| 3           | E2      | E3      | C       | E1      |
| 4           | E3      | C       | E1      | E2      |

**Original visual settings**: mornitor, keyborads, and a mouse
**Original background sounds**: keyboard, and mouse click
> 
> **Visual Adjustments (VA)**
> - Light Adjustment: Participants adjust brightness and color temperature of individual lighting devices, natural lights through the blinder (sit closed to the window).
> - Material Adjustment: Participants select and modify object materials, including the divider, table, wall, sound box, and desk surface.
> Customized items: calendar, books, photo frames, toys, and vegetations
>
> **Auditory Adjustments (AA)** 
> - Background noise level: adjust the height and material of the divider
> - Background music: activate the sound box, switch across classic music, Jazz, anime...[original sound level will be reduced]
> - Background natural sounds: activate the sound box, switch across bird song, forest ambience, water streams, ocean waves [original sound level will be reduced]
>
> **Thermal Adjustments (TA)** 
> Portable Neck Fans can be used for cooling/warming

## Prototype A [from Emotiv to Galea / from Galea to Emotiv]
### Tutorial :
##### VR session: 10 min
guidance for VA + AA + TA in an exisiting virtual enviroonment 

### Game Start [Emotiv to Galea]:
Select positions
move to the prefered postion, "I would like to sit here"
hand controller point to the computer monitor
"confirm"

### C (Control Group: original settings):
***Duration:20min***
##### VR Experience session: 8 min
- Activate Visual and Auditory Items
> **Interaction:** Use gaze tracking or the controller to point at and activate items without any actual interaction adjustments.
> **Observation:** Observe how participants' preferences for changing the same items in the environment vary under different experimental sequences.
- Inquire About Desire to Adjust Design Properties
> **Interaction:** After item activation, a simple interface pops up, and participants make selections using the controller. The selections are multiple choices to adjust design properties for one activated item with gif/video examples.
> **Observation:** Analyze whether participants' preferences for potential design changes differ under different experimental sequences and conditions.

##### VR Cognition performance test: less than 7 min [To(cpt)]
##### Survey in the virtual environment: [To(s)]

### E(a) (Galea + Survey in the real world):
***Duration:20min***
##### VR Experienec session: about 8 min 
- Design adjustment: about 5 min [Ta(v01)]
> VA + AA + TA in the middle sitting position
- Observation and Immersive Experience: 3min
>- After a confirmation of completing the adjustment sessions, participants can stand up and look around the unmodified environment, and enjoy their optimised design outcomes. 
>- Participants are encouraged to sit again and talk their modifications in the immersive experieneces with the headset.
##### VR Cognition performance test: less than 7 min [Ta(cpt)]
##### Survey: less than 8 min [Ta(s)]

### E(b) (Galea + Survey in the virtual world):
##### VR session: about 8 min 
- Design adjustment: about 5 min [Tb(v01)]
> VA + AA + TA in the sitting position closed to the window
- Observation and Immersive Experience: 3min
>- After a confirmation of completing the adjustment sessions, participants can stand up and look around the unmodified environment, and enjoy their optimised design outcomes. 
>- Participants are encouraged to sit again and talk their modifications in the immersive experieneces with the headset.
##### Cognition performance test: less than 7 min [Tb(cpt)]
##### Survey: about 5 min [Tb(s)]

### E(c) (Emotiv + Survey in the virtual world):
### Basic Tutorial in the new headset: 5 min
##### VR session: about 15 min 
- Design adjustment: about 5 min [Tc(v01)]
> VA + AA + TA in the sitting position closed to the window
- Observation and Immersive Experience: 3min
>- After a confirmation of completing the adjustment sessions, participants can stand up and look around the unmodified environment, and enjoy their optimised design outcomes. 
>- Participants are encouraged to sit again and talk their modifications in the immersive experieneces with the headset.

## Prototype B: Data Collection
#### Subjective Feedback:

#### Objective Feedback:
- Observe Eye Movements and Basic Motion Behavior
> **Observation:** Use built-in eye tracking SDK to observe participants' eye movements and head orientations during the VR experience.
> **Interaction:** 
> Compare the duration and focus points of gaze pre- and post-design changes to identify shifts in attention — are participants more engaged with modified objects?
> Changes in Exploration Patterns: Examine if participants’ exploration patterns change due to design adjustments — for instance, do changes in light lead to longer stares at previously less-noticed objects?
