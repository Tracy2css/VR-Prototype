### Experiment Design Steps

1. **Baseline Measurement**:
   - Record baseline data for all participants in a standard VR office environment without any additional sensory stimuli. This data includes work efficiency, eye-tracking, head movements, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Repeated Measures Experiment**:
   - Each participant will take part in all experimental groups, including the control group and various experimental groups, to assess the impact of different combinations of sensory stimuli on user experience and work efficiency.

3. **Experimental Group Settings**:
   - **Control Group (C)**: Participants complete tasks in the basic VR office environment without any sensory stimuli adjustments.
   - **Experimental Group 1 (E1, Visual + Auditory)**: Adjust both visual (light intensity, color temperature) and auditory (background music, environmental sounds) stimuli.
   - **Experimental Group 2 (E2, Visual + Thermal)**: Adjust visual stimuli and thermal comfort stimuli simulated through visual and auditory cues.
   - **Experimental Group 3 (E3, Visual + Auditory + Thermal)**: Adjust visual, auditory, and simulated thermal comfort stimuli to provide a comprehensive sensory experience.

4. **Balanced Order Design**:
   - Use a Latin square or a balanced crossover design to randomize the order of different experimental conditions to avoid order effects and fatigue.

### Example of Balanced Crossover Design

Suppose there are four experimental conditions: Control (C), Experimental Group 1 (E1), Experimental Group 2 (E2), and Experimental Group 3 (E3). A Latin square can be used to arrange the experiment order:

| Participant | Order 1 | Order 2 | Order 3 | Order 4 |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1           | C       | E1      | E2      | E3      |
| 2           | E1      | E2      | E3      | C       |
| 3           | E2      | E3      | C       | E1      |
| 4           | E3      | C       | E1      | E2      |

### Implementation Steps

1. **Baseline Measurement**:
   - Conduct baseline measurements for all participants in a standard VR office environment without any sensory stimuli.

2. **Experimental Execution**:
   - According to the sequence assigned to each participant, have them sequentially experience each experimental condition.
   - For example, Participant 1 will participate in the order C → E1 → E2 → E3.

3. **Data Recording and Rest**:
   - Record data such as work efficiency, eye tracking, head movements, etc., under each experimental condition.
   - Provide sufficient rest time for participants before switching to the next experimental condition to minimize fatigue effects.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Compare and analyze the performance of participants under different experimental conditions to determine the impact of various sensory stimuli combinations.
   - Use statistical tests such as repeated measures ANOVA, paired t-tests, or other relevant methods to assess significant differences in the data.

### Conclusion

This repeated measures design allows researchers to effectively evaluate the impact of multisensory stimuli on the same group of participants while controlling individual differences. This approach enhances the precision of measuring and understanding the effects of different sensory stimuli combinations on user experience and behavior. By implementing this method, the virtual environment becomes not only a reflection of user preferences but also a dynamic space that provides essential data for optimizing user experience based on robust scientific evidence. This comprehensive approach ensures that the virtual environment is more vibrant and responsive to user needs, laying a solid foundation for future enhancements based on the study's findings.
