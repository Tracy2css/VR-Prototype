### **Analysis of Material Selection and Sensory Experience**

1. **Wall Material**:
   - **Matte gray walls**: Chosen for their low reflectivity, matte walls reduce light glare, making them ideal for extended work periods where comfort and reduced visual fatigue are crucial. This material creates a more calm and subdued visual experience, suitable for focus-driven tasks.
   - **Glass surface**: Highly reflective, glass surfaces increase brightness and spatial perception by bouncing light around the environment. However, prolonged exposure to such brightness may cause eye strain or distractions, especially in high-glare settings. This material offers an engaging visual experience but may challenge comfort over long durations.

2. **Desk Material**:
   - **Natural wood**: Selected for its warm, tactile feel, wood desks promote comfort during long working hours. The natural texture adds a sense of relaxation and connection to nature, supporting a more calming sensory environment. This material provides both visual and tactile comfort, enhancing multisensory well-being.
   - **Marble**: With its cold, hard texture, marble desks offer a sleek, minimalist aesthetic. However, the coldness may lead to discomfort over extended periods, making it more suited for short, intensive tasks. The clean, reflective surface offers a modern, professional look but could induce sensory fatigue in a static environment.

3. **Floor Material**:
   - **Thick carpet**: Carpet was chosen for its ability to absorb sound, reducing ambient noise and creating a quieter, more focused auditory experience. This soft material also adds to physical comfort, especially for environments where users might spend long hours. The reduced sound reflection helps mitigate distractions and improves concentration.
   - **Tile flooring**: Hard surfaces like tile reflect sound, creating more echo and a lively atmosphere. This auditory quality might be beneficial in dynamic, collaborative spaces but could hinder focus in individual workstations. The harder material also creates a more formal, structured auditory environment, stimulating engagement in active tasks.

---

### **Sensory Experience Correspondence**

- **Visual Sensory Experience**: Materials like **matte walls** and **natural wood** desks support a calming, comfortable environment that reduces sensory overload, making them suitable for longer work sessions. These materials align with visual comfort and tactile satisfaction, contributing to a grounded, immersive workspace.
  
- **Auditory Sensory Experience**: Soft materials like **carpet** and **heavy curtains** provide sound absorption, enhancing acoustic comfort. These materials help create a quiet and focused space, reducing distractions from external noise. In contrast, reflective materials like **tile flooring** amplify sound, offering a more dynamic auditory experience, which might be stimulating in collaborative or short-burst work environments.

These material selections represent key sensory differences, allowing the experiment to analyze how distinct textures and acoustic properties affect cognition, comfort, and productivity in a VR-based open workstation.

| **Sensory Adjustment Scenario** | **Interaction 1** | **Interaction 2** | **Interaction 3** | **Ineraction 4** |
|------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **VA (Visual Adjustment)**         | **Visual Task 01**: Adjusting Lighting to Improve Visibility | **Visual Task 02**: Personalising Workspace Appearance | —          | —          |
| **VAA (Visual + Auditory Adjustment)** | **Visual Task 01**: Adjusting Lighting to Improve Visibility | **Auditory Task 01**: Positioning Movable Acoustic Barriers | —          | —          |

Got it! Let’s focus on the reasoning behind **integrating specific tasks within each sensory adjustment combination** (VA, VAA, VTA, MSA), rather than explaining each task individually. 

- **Cross-Combination Consistency**: **Visual Task 01** is included in all combinations to maintain a consistent baseline.
  
- **Diversity in Sensory Modalities**: In each combination, Interaction introduces a **new sensory adjustment**.

- **Engagement and Avoiding Fatigue**: While the visual baseline task remains constant, other sensory adjustments (such as auditory or thermal controls) are varied to maintain interest. Additionally, ==[Q:workstation change before each adjustment can add minor variants of Visual Task 01.]==
