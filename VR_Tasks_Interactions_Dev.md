- **Interaction**:
  - ***Activating Auto Mode of a Dyson fan***: 
    - *Using the VR controller to select the Dyson fan in their workstation, ==a simple control panel== appears, showing toggle of activating auto mode of the fan.*
  - ***Setting Fan Direction***
    - *The fan direction can be ==locked in place or set to oscillate to== cover a wider area*.
- **Gamification**:
  - *When the speed or direction is adjusted, the settings of the real fan will be adjusted accordingly*

### 3. Thermal Adjustment Task Design
#### **2.1 Auditory Task 01**: Personal Cooling/Heating for Focus
- **Scenario**: Participants can adjust the fan’s speed and direction to improve comfort.
- **Interaction**:
  - ***Adjusting Fan Speed and fan direction***: 
    - *Using the VR controller to select the Dyson fan in their workstation, ==a simple control panel== appears, showing a fan speed slider. They can ==adjust the speed of the fan by sliding the control from low to high==.*
  - *The fan direction can be ==locked in place or set to oscillate to== cover a wider area*.
- **Gamification**:
  - *When the speed or direction is adjusted, the settings of the real fan will be adjusted accordingly*
